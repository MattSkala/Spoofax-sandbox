# Getting started

This repository will be your place to submit your work for grading. On the [course website](https://tudelft-cs4200-2018.github.io/) we have written documentation for you on [how to get started](https://tudelft-cs4200-2018.github.io/documentation/git.html#getting-started), [how to submit a solution](https://tudelft-cs4200-2018.github.io/documentation/git.html#submitting-an-assignment), etc.

You are free to use any amount and organization of branches that you like. However, we require that your final solution ends up in the appropriate branch for that assignment, i.e. `assignment-1-develop`, `assignment-2-develop`, etc. as explained on the course website. Also note that some assignments can have a warning that they have not been fully updated for this year and are subject to change. 

# Early feedback

For some of the assignments, early feedback will be given through automated grading. In order to receive early feedback, you can create a merge request as explained in the documentation on how to submit an assignment. A report will be posted in your project as a snippet. The automated grading system will only give you feedback a few times, so be strategic about when you push changes to your submissions branch. Reports typically include a tentative grade. Be aware that reports might be delayed due to submissions by other students, server problems, etc. We do not give early feedback on the day of a deadline, since this will not be early at all.
